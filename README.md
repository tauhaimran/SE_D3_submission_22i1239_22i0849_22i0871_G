This repository contains the final D3 Submission for our Software Engineering (SE) Project. Due to persistent issues with GCR (Git Classroom Repository), we have hosted the submission here on GitHub. As a workaround, our roll numbers are included in the repository name for clear identification.

## Main Project Repositories

All project code, documentation, and workflows are hosted in the following branches of the main project repository:

**- Main Branch (Final Codebase):**
  https://github.com/minahilali117/ProjectPulse/tree/main

**- Testing Branch (Includes Documentation):**
  https://github.com/minahilali117/ProjectPulse/tree/testing

**- Workflow & Testing Automation Branch:**
  https://github.com/minahilali117/ProjectPulse/tree/workflow-TESTING-BRANCH
